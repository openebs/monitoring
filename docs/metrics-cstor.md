# Monitoring cStor Engine

## Metrics supported by cStor volume as of the current release are

These metrics are collected by cStor ServiceMonitor that describes the cStor service targets to be monitored by Prometheus which
ultimately exposes the cStor volume endpoints where the below mentioned metrics are exposed.

Refer to this [link](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/getting-started.md) to get a better understanding of how ServiceMonitor works.

```
openebs_actual_used # Actual volume size used
openebs_connection_error_total # Total no of connection errors
openebs_connection_retry_total # Total no of connection retry requests
openebs_degraded_replica_count # Total no of degraded/ro replicas
openebs_healthy_replica_count # Total no of healthy replicas
openebs_logical_size # Logical size of volume
openebs_parse_error_total # Total no of parsing errors
openebs_read_block_count # Read Block count of volume
openebs_read_time # Read time on volume
openebs_reads # Read Input/Outputs on Volume
openebs_sector_size # sector size of volume
openebs_size_of_volume # Size of the volume requested
openebs_total_read_bytes # Total read bytes
openebs_total_replica_count # Total no of replicas connected to cas
openebs_total_write_bytes # Total write bytes
openebs_volume_status # Status of volume: (1, 2, 3, 4) = {Offline, Degraded, Healthy, Unknown}
openebs_volume_uptime # Time since volume has registered
openebs_write_block_count # Write Block count of volume
openebs_write_time # Write time on volume
openebs_writes # Write Input/Outputs on Volume
```

## Metrics supported by cStor to export the cStorStoragePool usage statistics as Prometheus metrics

These metrics are collected are cStor podMonitor which declaratively specifies how groups of cStor pool pods should be monitored.

Refer to this [link](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/rest_api/monitoring_apis/podmonitor-monitoring-coreos-com-v1.html#apismonitoring-coreos-comv1podmonitors) to get a better understanding of how PodMonitor works.
